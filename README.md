Project 1 Digital Skola

A Project 1 was an implementation of the Python concept, namely Object Oriented Programming, known as OOP. Coach Muhammad Singgih Prastio was the mentor of this project, he managed project tasks and taught line by line streamingly. These are the following tasks:

1. Make a parent objects namely "library items"
2. Make child objects they are "Book","Magazine","CD","DVD"
3. Make an automation with class "Search"
4. Simulate some cases using json data.

For dummy json, I ask a Chatgpt help to generate it.
